								By Benjamin Kennedy Jr.,<br />
								Special to OpenHerBox.com<br />
								New York City, New York 10007<br />
								October 23, 2016 - Updated
							</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Dear Friend,</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 0px;"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n February 6, 2010,  three corrupt researchers discovered a "loophole" in the female mind.</p>
							<p>My name is Benjamin. And I'm writing this letter because you'll never read about this research in the paper... hear about it on the news... and this is the most you'll ever read about it on the internet. Yet this tiny piece of science is the key to as much intense, passionate sex as you can handle.</p>
							<h3>
								"Because This Loophole Allows Any Man<br />
								To Read A Woman's Thoughts<br />
								As If They Were Written On Paper..."<br />
							</h3>
							<p>Even if you've "trained" with these techniques for less than one hour.</p>
							<p>A leading Harvard Psychologist, 19 major corporations (such as GE, The Wharton School of Business and even The US Army) as well as this Ph.D. professor from UCLA all use this research for themselves:</p>
							<h5 class="sub">"The Most Insightful Science I've Seen In YEARS...</h5>
							<img src="http://3simplequestions.com/readhermind/imagesv2/ucla.png" style="margin: 25px 0px 25px 75px;" />
							<p>…And those corrupt scientists tested over 1,026 women in The United States, so far. So the science is real, and proven.</p>
							<p>Thanks to this breakthrough...</p>
							<h3>
								"You Can Get A Phone Number,<br />
								A Date Or Even A <br />
								First Kiss With ANY Woman<br />
								In 5 Minutes Or Less..."
							</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>Here's exactly how it works:</strong></p>
							<img src="http://3simplequestions.com/readhermind/imagesv2/step1_num.png" style="margin: 5px;"/>
							<img src="http://3simplequestions.com/readhermind/imagesv2/step1.png" style="margin: 40px 10px 0pt 15px; float: right;" />
							<p><strong>Pick a girl that you like RIGHT NOW.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Be careful what you wish for -</em> <strong>make absolutely certain it would be OK if she was helplessly in love with you and chasing you...</strong></p>
							<br />
							<img src="http://3simplequestions.com/readhermind/imagesv2/step2_num.png" style="margin: 5px;"/>
							<img src="http://3simplequestions.com/readhermind/imagesv2/step2.png" style="margin: 25px 10px 0px 15px; float: right;" />
							<p>You say one of the three "attraction boosters." Three easy sentences proven to make a woman more sexually attracted to you. (They trigger the chemical Oxytocin in her brain - a bonding chemical also shot into her blood when she has an orgasm)  </p>
							<br /><br />
							<img src="http://3simplequestions.com/readhermind/imagesv2/step3_num.png" style="margin: 5px;"/>
							<img src="http://3simplequestions.com/readhermind/imagesv2/step3.png" style="margin: 30px 10px 0pt 15px; float: right;" />
							<p>You ask her three common questions. Then you listen. That's all the talking you need to do.</p>
							<br /><br />
							<img src="http://3simplequestions.com/readhermind/imagesv2/step4_num.png" style="margin: 5px;"/>
							<img src="http://3simplequestions.com/readhermind/imagesv2/step4_var1.png" style="margin: 30px 10px 0px 15px; float: right;" />
							<p>You follow a few step by step directions. You get her phone number, a date or even a kiss in under 5 minutes. It's that simple. Are the directions difficult? No, they're not. They work on her mind and on her body... so... <span class="highlight"><strong>You create a ton of trust, love and attraction, with just a little elbow grease.</strong></span> </p>
							<br />
							<p> Best of all... </p>
							<h3>
								"You Can <u>Also</u> Use These 4 Effortless Steps<br />
								To Get A Girlfriend, Wife Or Even <br />
								A Hot, Sweaty One Night Stand..."<br />
							</h3>
							<p>You can turn ANY woman into your wife, girlfriend or hot and sweaty one night stand using the same <u>three questions</u> you asked her, above.</p>
							<p>You'll follow the exact same steps. You walk into a bar or club. You see a woman who turns you on. You ask her those same, common questions. You turn her into your girlfriend... wife... or even a hot one night stand. </p>
							<p>Best of all – <u>You</u> make the call. Not her.</p>
							<ul>
								<li class="mylistred">You'll never "slum" for ugly women - you only talk to women who turn you on.</li>
								<li class="mylistred">You'll never worry about "chemistry" – when she answers your questions, you follow the directions. Science guarantees she'll be turned on by you. </li>
								<li class="mylistred">You'll never lose "the spark." And your relationship will never go "stale." Because... again... science and psychology take care of the heavy lifting: You just ask her the questions, then listen to her answers.</li>
							</ul>
							<br />
							<p>But that's not all...</p>
							<div class="insetbox3"> <img src="http://3simplequestions.com/readhermind/imagesv2/logos.png" class="imageInsert" /> </div>
							<h3>
								"You Can Also Radiate Confidence
								Just Like An Alpha Male,
								And Never Get Rejected Again..."
							</h3>
							<div class="mylistred" style="text-indent: 0pt;">You'll say exactly what she wants to hear, next...</div>
							<div class="mylistred" style="text-indent: 0pt;">You'll "make your move" at the exact right moment...</div>
							<div class="mylistred" style="text-indent: 0pt;"><strong>You'll give her an intense, toe curling orgasm...</strong> and shoot even MORE of the chemical Oxytocin into her blood stream... </div>
							<br />
							<p>…All because you asked her the <strong>right</strong> three questions. And then followed a few crystal clear directions.</p>
							<p><strong>You'll get the girl every time, when you treat her the way she wants to be treated.</strong> And these common questions tell you how she wants to be treated, in crystal-clear detail. Just look at her 3 answers.</p>
							<p>Then let the science do it's magic.</p>
							<p>These three common questions can help you do even more...</p>
							<h3>
								"You Can <u>Also</u> Make A Woman<br />
								Fall So Deeply In Love,<br />
								She's Hooked On You And Your Sex..."
							</h3>
							<p>Picture this: You meet a gorgeous woman. She's exactly "your type." She makes you laugh, she makes you smile and she satisfies your every sexual fantasy.</p>
							<p>You date for a few months, and she's still perfect. You still have sex almost every day. You still laugh and smile together. You still are head over heels in love.</p>
							<p>Would you ever cheat on her? Of course not! Now, if your woman was<em> this</em> happy and satisfied, do you think she'd ever cheat on you? Of course not!</p>
							<p><span class="highlight"><strong>Your girlfriend is guaranteed to stay loyal, when you use this psychology. </strong></span>She'll be addicted to your love. And she'll beg you for sex – the more, the better!</p>
							<h3>
								"This Means You Can Seduce Any Woman<br />
								You Want. All You Need To Do Is<br />
								Imagine Her, Now..."
							</h3>
							<p>You'll just follow the steps to turn your friend into your girlfriend (And she'll never stick you in "The Friend Zone," again)...</p>
							<p>You'll transform your hot co worker into your sex-kitten (Even though your boss has no idea you're dating)...</p>
							<p>The women you meet at the bar or club... Women you walk past, every day, on the street... Even your Mom or sister's friends are all - finally - "fair game," thanks to this 'loophole' in the female mind.</p>
							<h3>
								"And It's All Thanks To This Brand New Science. Here's How It Makes You A Happier Single Man<br />
								(Or Helps You Land A Dream Relationship...)"
							</h3>
							<p>Different women like different things. Yet most men – including you – use the same techniques to get different women into bed.</p>
							<p>The fact is: Your techniques only work on a select number of women. No matter how powerful they are.</p>
							<p>As this new science tells us, women have three crucial worries about men, dating and sex. One crucial worry for each topic.</p>
							<p>Her "Yes" or "No" answers to three common questions – one question for each worry – are all you need to know, to tell which "type" of woman she is.</p>
							<p>Know her type, and you know how to turn her on, what to say and how to make her come home with you. You know how to get a one night stand and even how to make her your girlfriend.</p>
							<ul>
								<li class="mylistred">You'll take her breath away on your very first date. </li>
								<li class="mylistred">You'll give her an orgasm your first time in bed. </li>
								<li class="mylistred">You'll even keep her satisfied in a long term relationship. (These tactics reduce cheating in relationships! Studies showed record lows)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>In fact, here's a taste of what you'll discover about each type of woman:</p>

							<h3>
								"The Bad News: Those Dirty Researchers<br />
								Kept This Extraordinary Science PRIVATE,<br />
								For Decades..."
							</h3>
							<p>This gang of researchers hid their discovery because it could be extremely dangerous – in the wrong hands. The good news is, they hid it in plain sight...</p>
							<p>They published their findings in psychology books. But... instead of calling their research "Female Psychology"... They called it "Dimensional Personality Traits And The Prediction of DSM-IV." (Among other, confusing, technical names)</p>
							<p>This way, they kept their secrets private. And away from prying eyes, like ours...</p>

								"Until A Lonely Ex-Janitor
								Stumbled Upon This Science
								And Seduced HUNDREDS Of Women With It..."
							</h3>
							<p>This man's name is Vin DiCarlo. And... not even a year ago, today... He "sniffed out" the secrets in these 96+ books and articles. He saw this research for what it <strong>really</strong> was: A key into any woman's fantasies about sex. And therefore, a way to get any woman into bed!</p>
							<p>He ran hundreds of independent "studies" on beautiful women. And the results were incredible:</p>
							<li class="mylistred">He gets women <strong>chasing him and fantasizing about him - all from a single dinner date!</strong></li>
							<li class="mylistred">He <strong>escapes the friend zone</strong> by sparking gut-level attraction from women he knows... Even if they rejected him before!</li>
							<li class="mylistred">He gets threesomes easily, and gets his girlfriends to be <strong><u>OK with the fact that he's dating multiple women</u></strong></li>
							<li class="mylistred">He KNOWS women... <strong><em>even better than they know themselves...</em></strong> and can seduce them <strong>even if she has a boyfriend!</strong></li>

							<p>Vin's friend Brian interviewed eight different women. One for each of the 8 types of woman. Each of these women is unique. And together, they represent every type of woman alive. So you'll know everything there is to know about women, sex and dating the second you finish watching these interviews. </p>
							<p>You'll be amazed what women reveal, when you tell them its a scientific study. And you'll watch the first video interview as a "Thank You" present, since you've decided to open Pandora's Box.</p>
							<p>(You simply click "Play" on your web browser to view it)</p>
							<p>You'll meet Fernanda in this half hour interview. She's a gorgeous Latin girl with a fun, sensual personality. You'll hear her reveal all of the following:</p>
							<img src="http://3simplequestions.com/readhermind/imagesv2/fernandastrip.png" class="insetbox4" />
							<div class="mylistred1"><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>"The Letter Secret"</strong> - How to get her alone and make her fall in love without meeting her in person <em>(This trick is a favorite in cheesy movies...)</em></p></div>
							<div class="mylistred1"><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>Five words she hates to whisper</strong> but she still says every day of her life. How to turn them against her and get her addicted to your touch...</p></div>
							<div class="mylistred1"><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>How to touch her to turn her on</strong> and why this part of her waist is the sexiest place to lay your hands... your fingers... your lips... (HINT: Nope its NOT the belly button)</p></div>
							<div class="mylistred1"><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>Better than confidence!</strong> The single most important thing she looks for, in a man...</p></div>
							<div class="mylistred1"><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>Main mistakes most guys make</strong> with "The Cinderella" - and how to avoid them <em>(Avoid these mistakes and you'll capture this romantic woman at her most charming moment...)</em></p></div>
							<div class="mylistred1"><p style="text-indent: 0px;"><strong>Her terrible, guilty secret</strong> and why this conscious killer keeps her from dating her ideal man <em>(especially when she's busy doing this...) </em></p></div>
							<p>...Plus a whole bunch more. The interview is 23 minutes long, after all.</p>
							<p>You'll get two weeks to watch Fernanda's interview and tell Vin what you think. You'll watch a new girl interviewed every month after that. (And you'll watch a brand new half hour segment every week)</p>
							<p>Plus, to save you time and money, Vin will automatically send you the new interview and update your membership until you tell him to stop.</p>
							<p>That way, he can guarantee you'll never miss a single interview. And you'll know how to talk to every woman, no matter her answers to your three, common questions.</p>
